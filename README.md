This addon will change the `dom.event.contextmenu.enabled` preference based on the hostname of the current page.

The `extensions.enablecontextperdomain.domains` preference contains a comma seperated list of hostnames which are allowed to overwrite the context menu.
The list should always start and end with a `,`.
After modifiying the list you will need to restart your browser for this to take effect.

To install the addon you have to zip everything in the root of this repository (not the root folder itself) and rename the file to .xpi. Then just drag the file onto Firefox and it should ask you to install the addon.

Comments, patches or questions can be placed here on github or send to erik@dubbelboer.com.
