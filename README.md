This addon will change the `dom.event.contextmenu.enabled` preference based on the hostname of the current page.

The `extensions.enablecontextperdomain.domains` preference contains a comma seperated list of hostnames which are allowed to overwrite the context menu.
The list should always start and end with a `,`.
After modifiying the list you will need to restart your browser for this to take effect.
